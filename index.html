<p align="left"><font size="+2">Earthen Joy restaurant opened in Tempe, Arizona 
  about 40 years ago. It was located at 36 east 5th Street in Tempe, Arizona near 
  the Gentle Strength Co-op and quickly helped define the Tempe lifestyle of the 
  1970s.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2"> The little restaurant was created by Culver and 
  Wylie van Buren (center left above). Its reputation for natural food with an 
  epicurean flair quickly grew, as did the family of individuals that work there.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">I was the first employee and worked at Earthen 
  Joy for most of its life. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">I'm compiling information and remembrances of 
  Earthen Joy, its stories, and its impact on the lives of those who ate there. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">Who of you remember the Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf 
  Supreme, or the Sheepherder with its chunky tomato vegetable soup and little 
  whole wheat loaf from Christopher's Bakery on Mill Avenue? Do you remember the 
  blender drinks, like the Elmer Fudd? How about the evening specials like the 
  Coquille Saint Jacques served in a scallop shell. And was anyone able to escape 
  being enchanted by Wylie's carob cake and carob sauce?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">If you would like to share photos, stories or 
  thoughts, we can add them to this site.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+2">If you worked at, or remember Earthen Joy, I'd 
  appreciate hearing from you.</font></p>
